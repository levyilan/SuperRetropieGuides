# Playstation 1 Tools


## PSX2PSP

 > PSX2PSP is a tool that can create eboot (PBP) files from .bin/.cue or .iso files.  Currently PCSX-Rearmed's support for pbp seems a little broken.  If you have a multi disc game though, .pbp is the only option you may have.
 



## CDMage

 > CDMage is a tool to convert multiple track .bin files and a single .cue file, into one continuous .bin/.cue.  Simply load in your .cue file (if it complains it can't find the corresponding .bin, make sure to edit the .cue file and fix the file name's first).  Then save your new .bin/.cue and out will come a perfect single set, combining those multiple tracks into one image.  You can then use this image with the other tools.




## PocketISO 3.2

 > PocketISO 3.2 is a tool to compress and slim down PSX roms.  You can use it to simply compress your bin/cue into a .Z and .Z.table files (the two should remain together).  PCSX-rearmed has support for .Z (zlib compressed) files and it works very well.  It also provides extra ways of saving space in the roms if you prefer, you can replace the videos inside with a much shorter video, or rip them out alltogether (some games may break if videos are completely removed though, you will need to experiment and test).  It also provides options for removing or compressing audio tracks.  There are videos on youtube that provide more guidance with this tool.
