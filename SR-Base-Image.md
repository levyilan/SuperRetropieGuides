## Getting Started

# What do I need to get things setup after writing the SD card?
> Add your Wifi name and password: First locate the wpa_supplant.conf. Modify the file with your real wifi name and wifi password and then drop it in the boot partition. Remember pi zero only supports 2.4 Ghz networks, so you should set your 2G ssid and not your 5G.

* Add your bios’ and roms
    * Place your bios for the systems you plan to play into your bios directory.
    * Please refer to the Retropie Wiki for more information: [RetroPie-Setup/wiki](https://github.com/RetroPie/RetroPie-Setup/wiki)
    
    * Place your roms to the roms directory under the proper folder.
    * Please refer to the Retropie Wiki for more information: [RetroPie-Setup/wiki](https://github.com/RetroPie/RetroPie-Setup/wiki)
    
    * The games under Ports will also need roms.

## Some other cool things you can do:

  *	Add video snaps and screenshots by “Scraping” your roms.  See [https://www.skraper.net](https://www.skraper.net)
  * If you want to reduce the size of your video snaps to free up room for games, and make them load faster, see our guide here: [https://sinisterspatula.github.io/SuperRetropieGuides/snapsconversion](https://sinisterspatula.github.io/SuperRetropieGuides/snapsconversion)
